Module 2  - VBA Challenge

## Instructions: 

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
